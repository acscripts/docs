# Bridge
Bridge module gives you access to functions controlling player's inventory (mostly).  
Thanks to this, ac_documents is compatible with almost any inventory. Only requirement is metadata support.

We provide pre-made bridges for:
- [OX Inventory](https://github.com/overextended/ox_inventory)
- [QB Inventory](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-inventory)
- [LJ Inventory](https://github.com/loljoshie/lj-inventory)
