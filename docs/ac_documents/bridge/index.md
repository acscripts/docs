# Bridge
Bridge module gives you access to functions controlling player's inventory.  
Thanks to this, ac_documents is compatible with any inventory that supports item metadata.

We provide pre-made bridges for:
- [OX Inventory](https://github.com/overextended/ox_inventory)
- [LJ Inventory](https://github.com/loljoshie/lj-inventory)

:::note
Data types in the following **bridge** docs section fields are written in TypeScript interface format as it provides much more flexibility and **clarity** than any other format.
Question mark (`?`) means that the option is optional.  
You can find more information about TypeScript interfaces [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/objects.html).
