# Control visible sections using ACE permissions

You can control the visibility of individual sections in the scoreboard using ACE permissions.  
This is useful if you want to show/hide certain sections only for certain players.

This guide will use the *groups* section as an example, but it works the same for all options.



## Requirements
- understanding of FiveM ACE permissions  
- your own custom logic for controlling and setting the permissions



## Configuration
To enable ACE permissions for a section, you need to change the value of it in the `config.lua` file.

**There are 3 valid values:**  
`true{:lua}`: Visible for everyone  
`false{:lua}`: Completely disabled and hidden for everyone  
`'limited'{:lua}`: Visible only for players with the required ACE permission

In this case, we want to use the last value â†’ `'limited'{:lua}`.



## Steps

<Steps>

### Modify the config file
Change the value of `groups` in `visibleSections` from `true{:lua}` to `'limited'{:lua}`.

```lua {2} /'limited'/
visibleSections = {
    groups = 'limited',
    players = true,
    playerNames = true,
    playerIds = true,
    statusIndicators = true,
    footer = true,
},
```

### Restart the resource

### Set the ACE permission
Use your own custom code and logic to set the ACE permission for specific players you want to see the group section. You can use [this](https://forum.cfx.re/t/90917) guide as a reference.

ACE permission for the group section is `scoreboard.show.groups`.  
For other options, just replace `groups` with the name of the option (e.g. `scoreboard.show.playerNames`).

You can set the ACE permission using `ExecuteCommand` in your server-side code
```lua filename="server.lua"
ExecuteCommand('add_ace group.admin scoreboard.show.groups allow')
```

or anywhere in your `server.cfg` file.
```bash filename="server.cfg"
add_ace group.admin scoreboard.show.groups allow
```

You can add or remove the permissions during runtime. It will take effect immediately after reopening the scoreboard.

### Test it
If you did everything correctly, the group section will be visible only for players with the `scoreboard.show.groups` ACE permission. In this example, we set it to the `group.admin` group.

**In case it's not working, read this whole page again from the beginning and check if you missed something.**
