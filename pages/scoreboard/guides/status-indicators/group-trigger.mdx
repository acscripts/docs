# Group count based automation of states

You can use the integrated option to automatically change the states of status indicators based on the count of players in specified groups.

This guide will show you how to configure the `bank_robbery` status indicator, but it works the same for all indicators.



## Configuration
You have to set the desired values in the `config.lua` file.  
The entire configuration is done using the `groupTrigger` field.

```lua filename="config.lua" {6-10} /'bank_robbery'/
statusIndicators = {
    {
        id = 'bank_robbery',
        label = 'Bank robbery',
        icon = 'mdi:bank',
        groupTrigger = {
            groups = {'police', 'sheriff'},
            minimumCount = 12,
            includeOffDuty = true,
        },
    },
},
```

**`groups`**  
Array of group names whose total count will be compared to the `minimumCount` value.  
If the total count is greater or equal to the `minimumCount`, the indicator will be enabled.

**`minimumCount`**  
Minimum count of players in the specified groups to enable the indicator.

**`includeOffDuty`**  
Whether to include off-duty players in the total count.



## Overriding the current state
You can still manually change the state of the indicator, even if it's set to be automatically controlled.  
However, this doing so will forcibly override the automated state until you remove the manual override.

You can do so using the `forceIndicatorState` export.  
The following example will force the `bank_robbery` indicator to be enabled no matter the group count.
```lua copy filename="server.lua" /'bank_robbery'/ /true/
exports.ac_scoreboard:forceIndicatorState('bank_robbery', true)

-- or use non-networked server event
TriggerEvent('ac_scoreboard:forceIndicatorState', 'bank_robbery', true)
```

The first argument is the indicator ID from `config.lua`.  
The second argument is a boolean value that forces the corresponding state.

If you want to remove the manual override, you can use the same export with the second argument set to `nil`.
```lua copy filename="server.lua" /nil/
exports.ac_scoreboard:forceIndicatorState('bank_robbery', nil)
```

Keep in mind that you cannot use the `setIndicatorState` export to change the state of indicators that are set to be automatically controlled. You can only use this (`forceIndicatorState`) export to temporarily override the automated state.
