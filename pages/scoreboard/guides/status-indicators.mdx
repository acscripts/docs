# Change states of status indicators

You can change the states of individual status indicators.  
This is useful if you want to indicate certain YES or NO states for players.

This guide will show you how to change the state of `house_robbery` status indicator, but it works the same for all indicators.



## Requirements
- ability to write your own custom logic for controlling the states



## Configuration
You need to find the status indicator ID. This can be found in the `config.lua` file.  
Each status indicator needs to have a unique ID so you can identify it.

```lua filename="config.lua" {2} /'house_robbery'/
statusIndicators = {
    { id = 'house_robbery', label = 'House robbery', icon = 'mdi:house', defaultState = true },
    { id = 'store_robbery', label = 'Store robbery', icon = 'mdi:store', defaultState = false },
    { id = 'bank_robbery', label = 'Bank robbery', icon = 'mdi:bank' },
},
```



## Steps

<Steps>

### Create a custom server resource
The state can be only changed from server-side resources.  
Create a new resource (or use an existing one) and add the following custom logic to it's server-side file.

### Use the `setIndicatorState` export
```lua filename="server.lua" /'house_robbery'/ /true/
exports.ac_scoreboard:setIndicatorState('house_robbery', true)
```

The first argument is the indicator ID from `config.lua`.  
The second argument is a boolean value that sets the corresponding state.

You can also use non-networked `ac_scoreboard:setIndicatorState` server event, which works the same way.  
```lua filename="server.lua" /'house_robbery'/ /true/
TriggerEvent('ac_scoreboard:setIndicatorState', 'house_robbery', true)
```

### Test it
Run your custom logic and see how the indicator state changes.  
All indicator changes take effect immediately after reopening the scoreboard.
