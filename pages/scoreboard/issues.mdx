## Scoreboard is not visible after opening it
You've downloaded the scoreboard source code instead of the *prebuilt* release.  
This resource uses Svelte for the frontend, which requires a build step.  
In case you don't know how to do this, just download the latest prebuilt version from the [releases page](https://github.com/antond15/ac_scoreboard/releases/latest).

## Status indicator icon is not showing
The icon must be a valid **Iconify** icon. You can find the list on [Ic√¥nes.js](https://icones.js.org/).  
Simply find your desired icon and copy it's name as shown in the example below.
