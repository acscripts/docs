## Unbuilt UI
This resource uses Svelte for the frontend, which requires a build step.  
If nothing happens when you open the scoreboard, you may need to build the frontend.  
In case you don't know how to do this, just download the prebuilt version from the [releases page](https://github.com/antond15/ac_scoreboard/releases/latest).
