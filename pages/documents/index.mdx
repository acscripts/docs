# Getting started

Make sure to read this carefully before using the script.

## Dependencies
- [OX MySQL (oxmysql)](https://github.com/communityox/oxmysql/releases/latest)
- your inventory system \*

\* Support for custom inventories can be done by editing the inventory [bridge](ac_documents/bridge).  
The default inventory bridge is for [ox_inventory](https://github.com/communityox/ox_inventory).  
All available inventory bridges provided by us are listed [here](ac_documents/bridge), however you can create your own.  
The inventory **must support metadata**!



## Database
Before using the resource, you need to import the `documents.sql` file into your database.  



## Creating items
Make sure to create items called `paper`, `document` and `crumpled_paper` in your inventory.  
You can change the used item names in `ac_documents/editable/config.lua`.  
You can use the following images or make your own.

<div className="flex mt-2">
	<Image src="/images/items/paper.png" alt="paper" width={100} height={100} quality={100} />
	<Image src="/images/items/document.png" alt="document" width={100} height={100} quality={100} />
	<Image src="/images/items/crumpled_paper.png" alt="crumpled_paper" width={100} height={100} quality={100} />
</div>



## Obtaining paper
We provide snippets for some inventories or shops, however you can also create your own.  
If you want to make your own system to get papers, use the following server export.
```lua copy filename="Your own script"
-- server side
local preset = 'MedicalReport'
local count = 1

exports.ac_documents:givePaper(source, preset, count)
```
