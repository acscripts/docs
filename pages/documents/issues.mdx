## Start order
ac_documents must be started **AFTER** ox_inventory.

**Recommended order**
```yaml filename="server.cfg"
ensure ox_inventory
ensure ac_documents
```

## How are document data stored
The document data are stored **separately** in database. Only the entry ID is stored in item's metadata.  
This way, we prevent ox_inventory from being bloated with redundant data.  
Each document is fetched from database only on request and then **cached**.
