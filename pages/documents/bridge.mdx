# Bridge

Bridge module gives you access to functions controlling player's inventory.  
Thanks to this, ac_documents is compatible with **any inventory that supports item metadata**.

<Callout type="error" emoji="üêÇ">
    **Use OX Inventory for the best experience. It's free, stable, secure and has full metadata support.**  
    *Other inventories listed below are not recommended due to security issues and lack of proper metadata support. Use them at your own risk.*
</Callout>

## Pre-made bridges
- [OX Inventory](./bridge/server/ox_inventory) (stable)
- [QB Inventory](./bridge/server/qb-inventory) (experimental)

<Callout emoji="üí°">
    You can create your own inventory bridge by following [**this**](./bridge/server) guide.  
    If you need help, you can ask on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/2ZezMw2xvR) in support ticket.

<Callout type="info">
    Even though we don't provide a pre-made bridge for it, you can still make your own!  
    This is our opinion only. You can use any inventory (with metadata) you want.
</Callout>

## Can you provide more pre-made bridges?
Yes, we can. But there are some requirements that the inventory must meet:
- Secured without any known exploits
- Full metadata support
- Free **OR** well documented (if paid)

\* This also aplies to LJ Inventory or other reskins.  
It is very exploitable. Metadata support is poorly written with lot of bugs.

\*\* QS Inventory is just a paid copy of QB Inventory. Strongly not recommended.
