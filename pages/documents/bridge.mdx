# Bridge

Bridge module gives you access to functions controlling player's inventory.  
Thanks to this, ac_documents is compatible with **any inventory that supports item metadata**.

<Callout type="error" emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">
    **Use OX Inventory for the best experience. It's free, stable, secure and has full metadata support.**  
    Other inventories listed below are not recommended due to security issues and lack of proper metadata support. Use them at your own risk.
</Callout>

## Pre-made bridges
- [OX Inventory](./bridge/server/ox_inventory) (stable)
- [QB Inventory](./bridge/server/qb-inventory) (experimental)

<Callout emoji="üí°">
    You can create your own inventory bridge by following [**this**](./bridge/server) guide.  
    If you need help, you can ask on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/2ZezMw2xvR) in support ticket.

<Callout type="info">
    Even though we don't provide a pre-made bridge for it, you can still make your own!  
    This is our opinion only. You can use any inventory (with metadata) you want.
</Callout>

## Can you provide more pre-made bridges?
Yes, we can. But there are some requirements that the inventory must meet:
- Secured without any known exploits
- Full metadata support
- Free **OR** well documented (if paid)

{<table style={{textAlign:'center', overflow:'hidden'}}>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Inventory</th>
      <th>Secured</th>
      <th>Metadata</th>
      <th>Free / Docs</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>OX Inventory</td>
      <td>‚úîÔ∏è</td>
      <td>‚úîÔ∏è</td>
      <td>‚úîÔ∏è</td>

    <tr>
      <td>ESX Inventory</td>
      <td>Somehow</td>

      <td>‚úîÔ∏è</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>QB Inventory *</td>
      <td>‚ùå</td>
      <td>Bad</td>
      <td>‚úîÔ∏è</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>QS Inventory **</td>
      <td>‚ùå</td>
      <td>Less bad</td>
      <td>‚ùå</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>}

\* This also aplies to LJ Inventory or other reskins.  
It is very exploitable. Metadata support is poorly written with lot of bugs.

\*\* QS Inventory is a paid copy of QB Inventory with additional bloat.
